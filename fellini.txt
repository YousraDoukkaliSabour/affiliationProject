reminds of of the vulnerability and self consciousness of ari aster
defensive posture, meta commentary on his own art, a look into his psyche, his disappointed father and how it shaped his art? subconscious/surrealism, Guido, the use of silence in the movie, catholic shame about sex, seeking validation from religious figure of power? he told his girlfriend to wear her mascara just like saraguina? someone tells him if he wants polemic about catholic consciousness in italy, he'd have to engage with a higher degree of culture as well as a rigorously clear headed logic, misogyny, cheating in a catholic society, double standards, women and age and sexism, sadomasochism, internalized misogyny trad wife archetype, "he needs to act this way" , possessivness, wanting to possess these women but losing interest in them, all of it pits these women in his life against eachother? when they get old, they go upstairs, vague ephemeral personages, one surreal scene about his relationship with women, another about his work, distorted consciousness, he wants to make an honest movie but he cant? he lies to his wife, shes bitter about it, he lies in the movie? strokes his ego, self indulgent about wanting to make an honest work of art but he cant be honest with his wife, he cant be honest with other women in his life that he drops when he loses interest, he cant decide what he wants, he wants to grab everything and devour it, he cant give up a single thing, he changes direction every day for fear of missing the path,he talks to the american actress in the scene at the beginning of the movie about the scene, she passes out the healing water, shes his salvation, there can be no salvation without church? he says almost uncertain and insecure? "theres no doubt that shes his salvation", yet he gives it all away because he doesnt know how o love? parallel with his art? he doesnt want to tell lies in his movies yet he lies to the women around him, he lies to himself, he doesnt know what he wants, "he doesnt know how to love" the american actress says about the character in his movie/him, hes paralyzed by his undecisiveness, "what do you think you can teach us, do you really thinkyour life can be of interest to others" "he is lost, he has nothing to say" , an unfinished skeleton of a structure possibly meaning his film, his life, his love? , revisit the end of the script to go over the producer's speech, the dissolution of his movie represents the squandering of the lies in his life in his art, he thinks its not true, hes relieved, hes not afraid to tell the truth anymore to his wife, himself, his art, the polemic? of this movie morphs from the subject being catholocism and sexuality through memories from his life, childhood to him being in crisis, in opposition with the women in his life, his art, and at the end, he destroys the self indulgence, the ego so he can finally face the truth without shame, the truth about what he knows , what he doesnt, the truth about what he wants, about his love, you can feel fellini's in crisis in this movie, a meta turning point in his art, at the end, he proceeds to direct a scene where all the people in his life descend down stairs from the structure he built for the movie, the first scene can be explain as him escaping the crowded and suffocating psychosphere and finally transcending what hes been reaching towards but in the beginning it was just a dream where he gets pulled back to earth, a yearning dream that seems to be fullfiled at the end, hes not scared or ashamed to face the truth anymore


Its been a long time since i watched a Fellini movie but i finally got around to it, this is his 7th movie or his eighth and a half movie counting his anthology segments '8 1/2', this is explicitly an autobiographical contemplation channelled through a fictional narrative of a representative character named Guido, a famous director suffering from his worst fear being realized which is losing his creativity, this is a movie thats constantly changing and morphing into something else, an embodiment of fellini's neuroses and anxieties about lack of creativity and turning them into fuel to create what he views as honest art, something Guido has been 
grasping for but was too dishonest and self indulgent to achieve, this may be represented in the first scene of the movie, a dream where Guido is stuck in traffic possibly meaning stalled creativity, his car filling up with suffocating smoke and his escape by way of flying only to be dragged back down into reality and waking up, 8 1/2 is similar to la dolce vita in its portrayal of italian upper class angst but more focused and contemplative, and surreal, the smoke appears again as a visual motif for stalled creativity, the dream sequences in this movie ,seemlessly blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, compel you to perceive things with a more surreal register, allowing you to directly engage with guido/fellini's psyche from his parents disappointment in him to the influence catholicism had in his formative years to themes of sadomasochism, possessivness, fear of love, hypocricy. Guido's film becomes a self serving tool to delude himself into thinking hes making sense of his life through art, that hes being honest, when in fact hes lying to himself and everyone around him but this delusion can only be satisfying for so long until this fragile lie collapses collapses in on itself possibly represented visually by a scene where he crawls under a table ,during a press conference where people berate him with questions and criticisms, and shoots himself destroying his delusion, hes fully exposed and vulnerable "accept me for what i am if you can, its the only way we might find eachother" Guido says to his wife/fellini gestures towards his audience, the movie which is a constantly changing journey that fellini shares with us in an attempt to make something honest reaching its final synthesis, i really loved this movie and i know that my thoughts are disjointed but theres just so much to say about it, i feel overwhelmed, idk how its possible but i liked this even more than la dolce vita, really excited to see the next one, hope i do it sooner





 shoots his ego
