more confident in camera movement, playful cinematography, the use of light, mother! was influenced by this? her mom knows her daughter's husband is cheating on her, she says a commen "why dont you put on more makeup" as if shes resenting her daughter for letting this happen to her, as if she caused her husband to cheat on her? i love the sudden cuts and editing in this movie, the music cuts abruptly too it doesnt carry on or fade out, her husband lightly flirts with the housekeeper women in front of her, shes invisible to him , he treats her with indifferent niceness/niceties? he dreams and mentions a woman named gabriella in his dreams, the way fellini uses voiceovers is so sharp and compelling, the way he portrays dreams is so , a voice calling her name "juliete" , maybe it is iris, the other voice in the beginning of the movie calling the woman a whore, theres a cultist mater that juliete went to, theyre mysognistic, juliete sees right through them, their gender is ambiguous, so this represents the second spirit at the beginning of the movie, the mysoginistic drive that puts down women, "something new will come to pass tonight, new and very beautiful", are you really determined to know? can she bare the truth and its consequences or does she keep pretending to be happy, the weaving between reality and fantasy in this movie is much more natural, almost as if its a reality of its own, as if theyre one in the same, her desires are stuck between the forces that want her to be a good wife whos "job" is to please her husband and iris, greek mythology, shes stuck between reigious trauma and her desires, she feels paralyzed in a marriage with someone who doesnt love her, religious trauma is represented by a woman being burnt at the stake, something she played in a play where her grandfather saved her from the fire, her grandfather ran away with a dancer and left her grandmother, she loves him, he isnt perfect but she admires his free spirit, shes afraid of her true desires, of her subconscious, auditory motif of the wind blowing from the west? representing iris, "get revenge, forgive who should i believe" "life is a sacrifice, be more feminine, we'll teach you" pulling her from each direction, laura speaks to her and tells her to do as she did, she cant bear the pain, maybe taking her own life, its like looking at someones subconscious, someones crying, dont move, obey your mother, you dont scare me anymore, the door opens, she frees herself as her father once freed her, irrationality of art, i cant try to explain fellini's try to achieve because art is at times created irrationally and to attempt to describe it would deflate it, it emerges and you the viewer transpose yourself onto it, to attempt to intellectualize art would assign a lower meaning to it, ones intentions can be contradictory to the result, film has a different rythm to life and viewer adapts to that rythm



just watched fellini's 9th movie "Juliet of the spirits", this is about Giulietta Boldrini, a middle aged housewife ,played by  Giulietta Masina (fellini's wife) my favorite actor from fellini's films so far, and her journey towards self liberation. 









an exercise in jungian visual analysis, we delve deeper into the subconscious with jung, she emerges from the shadow when her husband adresses her meaning her existence is dependent on him, she has no individuality, alot of the movie's visual language is fellini's exhibition of yung's theories of disorientation of consciousness that give way to forgotten contents of the unconscious such as the surreal visions of the boat and the voice of iris which guides her, the unconscious of juliette is populated by spirits of her mother, her father, her girl friend who took her own life because of love, the nuns, the catholic church, the school play where sexuality is rejected, th circus where its embraced, suzy represent the repressed sexuality of the character, composed, self controlled represents her detachment from the world of color, the circus of emotions shes subjected to by her unconscious, she frees herself from the ropes, the visions that come to save her of the circus or the male positive figure are subverted at the end of the movie by gullieta hearing her new inner voices, her friends, but this time , fellini chooses to know show them visually, they are her own,
